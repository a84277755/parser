# parser
simple parser tags (by text on page)


this app is only for demonstating purposes and it`s has potential bugs, leaks, used not perfect ways to implement and there is a lot of places to refactor.


It's easy to use.
You can receive selector from inputted text and url.
To start server use **npm start** or **node app**


Also was added **tryParseBySelector.js** file to test your selectors (it`s separate part of the application).
