With this app you can search CSS selectors.

This app is only for demonstration purposes and it`s has potential bugs, leaks, used not perfect ways to implement and there is a lot of places to refactor.

It's easy to use.

You can receive CSS selector from inputted text and url.

To start server use **npm start** or **node app**

Also was added **tryParseBySelector.js** file to test your CSS selectors (it`s separate part of the application).
